\subsection*{Golden Triangle Development}

Development of the Regional Rapid Rail Project will help streamline the construction process and will provide additional support as the Golden Triangle develops. Highlighting the need for transportation development and efficiency, which may result in more funding in the future. 
\subsection*{Tourism}

With the reduction of pollution (noise and general) in the Hauraki Gulf and an increased capacity for cruise ships in the reduced PoA, it allows Auckland to accelerate its tourism while generating economic value with the development of the downtown area within Auckland CBD.
 
\subsection*{Population distribution}
The movement of the main Port Hub down to Tauranga promotes a chance in the current population distributions and relieve the pressures on Auckland City. The cleared areas on the Auckland waterfront during relocation will provide more downtown housing and parking and could lower Auckland house prices.  

\subsection*{Regional Development}
Tauranga has the ability to grow into a larger city. As it expands, the number of higher income jobs will increase. This increased wealth in the area will have the benefit of increasing quality of life for residents.

\subsection*{Traffic}
With enhancements in traffic control in both Auckland and Tauranga, the travel time within these twos cities will be reduced. Widening the roads will decrease traffic congestion for workers and hence increase productivity at the workplace. This will enhance the characteristics of the business and therefore help produce more revenue.
